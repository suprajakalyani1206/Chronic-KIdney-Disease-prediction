## About the Project

Briefly explain what the project is about, its purpose, and what it aims to accomplish.

Example:
> This Project Discusses about Chronic Kidney Disease and its prediction using Random Forest Algorithm which is one of the Machine Learning Algorithms.The dataset used here includes 400 instances and 28 features, covering attributes such as blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and more. These attributes are important for diagnosing and predicting the risk of CKD.
